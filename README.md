# Linear-Regression-Final-Project
This projected was completed by my partner Zachary Dougherty and myself. We used a dataset that was given to use by the University of San Francisco, and it detailed information about the graduated Class of 2018 starting with information from their freshmen year in 2014. Zachary created two Linear Regression models using Ridge and Lasso to create predictive and explanatory models for the GPA of the students. I myself created two Logistic Regression models that predict whether the student graduated or not. I created two models because I created an unbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset.
